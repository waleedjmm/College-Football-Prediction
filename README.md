# COLLEGE FOOTBALL GAME PREDCTION
<p>I've developed an exciting Machine Learning project that's all about predicting College Football game spreads. Our model is so effective, it matches up with Vegas spreads - well-known experts in sports predictions. Our clients are thrilled; one of them even won 70% of their bets using our model!

The project involved some advanced data engineering. We gathered information using APIs and processed this data for our Google BigQuery Data Warehouse. To top it off, I created a user-friendly web application. This app lets users not only update data but also refine the model as needed. Check out the attached video to see it in action! </p>
